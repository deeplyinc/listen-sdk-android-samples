# Audio Recording

To use Listen sound event detection feature, we need to record audio from Android device. 
Listen SDK provides `DeeplyRecorder` for easy implementation of audio recording feature, which is a Kotlin Coroutine wrapper of AudioRecord. 
It is also possible to use Listen via `AudioRecord` and we introduce the both methods.
